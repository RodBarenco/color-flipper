1 - this is a color flipper!
2 - It was made following jhon smilga's tutorial at freeCodeCamp.
3 - there are 2 js files ( one for a simple number of 
    pre-defined colors, and other for all possible
    hexcolors), there are 2 html identical files, 
    but one linked to aap.js and the other linked to apphex.js.
    Finaly there is a css file.

4 - I'm open to feedbacks
    and collaboration.
    If you are looking for it,
    wellcome!
